Title: Estimating WJ LWID Scores from ROAR-LDT Scores
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Klint Kanopka
Maintainer: Klint Kanopka <kkanopka@stanford.edu>
Description: Takes in raw item responses from a ROAR-LDT administration and 
    turns them into an IRT-scaled score. From this and respondent age, estimates
    WJ LWID (raw) score, WJ LWID (standard) score, and WJ LWID percentile score. 
    These WJ estimates are done from pre-calibrated models that can be updated 
    as more ROAR-LDT data comes in.
